  <li>Jupyter Notebook <code>bigrams.ipynb</code>, which calculates the frequency of bigrams containing the word *kodu*. The code is meant to be used in the <a href="https://jupyter.hpc.ut.ee/">JupyterHub environment</a>, which user guide can be found in <a href="https://digilab.rara.ee/en/tools/access-to-dea-texts/#uagb-tabs__tab1">Digilab</a>. The results of the code appear in Table 1 of the thesis.</li>
